# Age Detection Model using Human Faces Dataset

This repository contains a machine learning model for age detection using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The model is trained to predict the age of individuals based on their facial features.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing this model is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trainingdatapro/age-detection-human-faces-18-60-years). It comprises a collection of images of human faces spanning ages 18 to 60 years old. The dataset is divided into different age groups and includes various images for each age category.

## Model Architecture
The age detection model is built using Keras and scikit-learn and utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image recognition tasks.
